# Technical exercise: Dancing with Death


**Part 1:**​ You will have to create a REST API for scheduling
appointments to have a dance with Death. The API has to be
implemented as a CRUD that keeps appointments, which will
be used in part 2 by a web client.

-   The system should not allow to book more than 1
appointment per hour.
-   The schedule must be set for office hours (9 am to 6
pm Monday to Friday) all year long
-   Death is very picky with its agenda, so every
appointment must contain date, start time and contact
information (like e-mail).
-   You can only appointment of 1 hour long with Death,
more would be pointless. Less would be too
traumatic.


**Part 2:​** Create a web client for the API you just created.

-   The first layout will display a date selector showcasing the current month.
-   If you click on any date, the available hour spaces will be displayed on screen to be
selected.
